# LocI Dataset Download
This repository is the container for the LocI project Deliverable 1: downloadable dataset identifiers.

It contains a folder for each dataset: [ASGS](ASGS), [Geofabric](Geofabric) & [GNAF](GNAF) which, in turn, contain all of the Microsoft Excel download files for each.

These Excel files were produced from the datasets' Linked Data distributions online created for LocI:

* ASGS: <http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/asgs>
* Geofabric: <http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/geofabric>
* GNAF: <http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf>

These were created, and can be recreated directly or in varied form, using the 'pyLDAPI Client' software tool, also created for LocI:
